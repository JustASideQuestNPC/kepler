# Kepler
If you're here from CoC, hi! Before you read anything else, go to the
[team hub](https://github.com/JustASideQuestNPC/team-ace-of-spades-hub), which is the actual reason
I posted this link.

The code here won't work on Khan Academy and is generally kind of terrible, but there's a ton of
decent JSDoc all over it.

Kepler is a modular library and engine for making 2D games using
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

### Modules
- **kepler.collider** adds colliders for points, lines, circles, and polygons.
  Check out the demo
  [here](https://editor.p5js.org/JustASideQuestNPC/sketches/DvpUykP9L).
- **kepler.engine** adds a single class for rendering and updating entities that
  can have any function. Check out the demo
  [here](https://editor.p5js.org/JustASideQuestNPC/sketches/if8Xp6yjS).
- **kepler.input** adds a simple, action-based system for using keyboard and
  mouse input. Check out the demo
  [here](https://editor.p5js.org/JustASideQuestNPC/sketches/PTGcKSAPh).
- **kepler.sprite** adds classes for easily loading and displaying sprites that
  can have any number of animations (or none at all). Check out the demo
  [here](https://editor.p5js.org/JustASideQuestNPC/sketches/2uOW2csh6).
